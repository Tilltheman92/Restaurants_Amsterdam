This is my finishing project of the 2. module in the Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp.
I decided to search for restaurants in my neighbourhood to explore, what kind of restaurant would be optimal to open at my location.

I split the project into 4 steps:
1. Data Collection (via Google Places API)
2. Data Cleaning (via Pandas)
3. Data Analysis (mostly via Tableau)
4. Presentation (PowerPoint)
